# Programming Challenges

Collection of problems i've solved for the Programming Challenges II (mc621) and IV (mc821) courses at Unicamp,
whose main objective was to serve as training for competitive programming contests, such as the ACM-ICPC.

The problems are organised inside folders named by the date in which each contest took place.
