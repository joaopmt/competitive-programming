# competitive-programming
A collection of some competitive programming problems I've solved, be it for practice, fun or as an class assigment

With the exception of the files in the misc folder, each problem file contains a link to the original problem statement commented out in the first line. If you want the problem statement but for some reason the link is broken, you can try searching the internet for the name of the file, as it is the same name as the original problem's name.
